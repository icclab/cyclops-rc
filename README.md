# New release
The RCB Cyclops 2.0 is finally available, please visit this <a href="https://github.com/icclab/cyclops">page</a> and update accordingly.

## Rating and Charging microservice
RC Service is one of the micro services as part of <a href="http://icclab.github.io/cyclops" target="_blank">CYCLOPS - A Rating, Charging & Billing solution</a> for cloud being developed by <a href="http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/">InIT Cloud Computing Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.zhaw.ch">ZHAW</a>. Rating & Charging micro service is responsible for creating the Charge Data Records (CDR) of a user and also the rate of a resource. The micro service supports different rating policies such as Static & Dynamic. Rating & Charging Service uses the Usage Data Records generated by the <a href="https://github.com/icclab/cyclops-udr">UDR Service</a> to combine with the rate of a cloud resource and calculate the Charge Data Records. The generated CDRs are made available for external applications through REST APIs using which charge and rate reports can be generated. 

### Download
     $ git clone https://github.com/icclab/cyclops-rc.git
### Installation
Make sure you've already installed <a href="https://github.com/icclab/cyclops-udr" target="_blank">UDR microservice</a>, as Rating and Charging requires the same prerequisites. If you want to run UDR and RC on different machines, then just install UDR's prerequisites, without deploying it again. Then continue with commands below:

     $ cd cyclops-rc/install
     $ chmod +x ./*
#### For OpenStack rating
     $ bash setup_for_openstack.sh
#### For CloudStack rating
     $ bash setup_for_cloudstack.sh
#### For Event based rating
     $ bash setup_for_events.sh

<b>Note</b>: Currently, it's not possible to have RC deployment of OpenStack, CloudStack and Event based metering at the same time, please select just one of them.
