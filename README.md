## Introduction
Rating & Charging micro service is responsible for creating the Charge Data Records (CDR) of a user and also the rate of a resource. The micro service supports different rating policies such as Static & Dynamic. Rating & Charging Service uses the Usage Data Records generated by the UDR Service to combine with the rate of a cloud resource and calculate the Charge Data Records. The generated CDRs are made available for external applications through REST APIs using which charge and rate reports can be generated.
